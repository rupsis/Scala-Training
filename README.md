# Scala-Training
Repository for Scala Training I'm presenting. 

This repo/training builds off:
-  the wonderful work of [Alvin Alexander](https://twitter.com/alvinalexander/) and his [Functional Programming, Simplified](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/functional-programming-simplified-book/) book. I'll refer to this as `FPS Book` in the text.
- [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653) (Know as the Scala "Red Book") by Paul Chiusano & RÃºnar Bjarnason. I'll refer to this as `The Red Book` in the text
